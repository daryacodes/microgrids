Adaptive Control in Smart Microgrids using Deep Reinforcement Learning

 --> Simulates a microgrid environment with changing energy inputs (solar, wind, battery) and usage demands. The RL agent learns a policy to balance storage, consumption, and external supply, optimizing for energy efficiency and cost over time.
